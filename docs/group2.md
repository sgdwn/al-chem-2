- Atomic radius increases down the group  
	o More neutrons, protons, and electrons, so atom gets larger  
- First ionisation energy  
	o Decreases down the group  
	o As the electrons get further away from the nucleus, there is less attractive force pulling them in to the nucleus, so electrons are easier to remove from a bigger atom  
- Melting points  
	o General downwards trend (with the exception of Magnesium)

- Boiling points  
o No general pattern or trend  

## Mg – Ba: Reactions with Water  
- Beryllium  
	o Reacts with steam at high temperatures (700°C+) to form white beryllium oxide + hydrogen  
- Magnesium  
	o Burns in steam, producing white MgO and H2 gas  
	o Mg ribbon has a reaction with cold water – after a few minutes of contact, some bubbles of H2 gas can be seen on the surface  
- Calcium, Strontium, Barium  
	o All react with cold water, producing metal hydroxides and hydrogen  
	o Become more vigorous down the group  
	o Strontium and Barium have comparable reactions to Lithium + water

- General trend: more reactive with water down the group  

## Magnesium to Extract Titanium  
- Magnesium can be used to extract titanium from 𝑇𝑖𝐶𝑙4  
- Titanium is extracted in a two part process  
	o 1. TiO2 is converted to TiCl4 by heating with chlorine and carbon at ~1000°C

	o 2. TiCl4 can be reduced using magnesium. This is done by passing the vapour into a reaction vessel containing molten magnesium and argon

- This method is used to prevent the formation of TiC, titanium carbide  
- TiC is very brittle, and could cause issues when the pure metal would be better  

## Solubilities of Mg – Ba in Water
- Hydroxides
	o Become more soluble down the group
	o Mg(OH)2 is sparingly soluble in water
	o Ca(OH)2 is used as ‘lime water’; 1l of water will dissolve 1g of CaOH
	o Ba(OH)2 is able to produce a solution with conc. of 0.1 mol dm-3 at room temp
- Sulfates
	o Become less soluble down the group
	o Barium sulfate is sparingly soluble, at 2mg per litre of water
	o Hydrated beryllium sulfate is soluble, beryllium sulfate is anhydrous

## Uses  
- Mg(OH)2  
	o Neutralise stomach acid, relieve indigestion, a laxative  
- Ca(OH)2  
	o Also called ‘slaked lime’, used to treat acidic soils  
- CaO or CaCO3  
	o To remove SO2 from flue gases  
- BaSO4  
	o Also called a ‘barium meal’; doesn’t allow x-rays to pass through the solution, so can be used to provide an image of a patients digestive tract with an x-ray  
	o Insoluble  
- Acidified BaCl2  
	o Used to test for sulfate ions
