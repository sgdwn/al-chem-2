## REDOX  
- **Reduction** – Loss of oxygen, gain of electrons, decrease in oxidation number  
- **Oxidation** – Gain of oxygen, loss of electrons, increase in oxidation number  
- **OILRIG** – Oxidation is loss, Reduction is gain  

## Half-Equation  
- Show to gain / loss of electrons in a REDOX reaction

1. Only show 1 species  
2. Electrons on the left if reduction Electrons on the right if oxidation  
3. Add H2O to balance any Oxygens  
4. Add H+ ions to balance the hydrogens (if needed)  
5. Balance electrons (e(-))  

## Oxidation Numbers  
- The charge that would exist on an atom if the bonding were ionic  
- O, S -2  
- Cl, Br, I -1  
- Any single element 0  
- Na, K, H + group 1 +1  
- Mg, Ca, Pb + group 2 +2  
- Al +3  
- Always a whole number – never a decimal  
- Always add to 0 in molecules  
- Oxidation Loss of electrons Increase in oxidation number  
- Reduction Gain of electrons Decrease in oxidation number
