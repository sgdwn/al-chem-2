- Very reactive  
- Non-metals  
## Electronegativity  
- Decreases down the group  
- Highest electronegativities towards the top right of the periodic table ‚Äì Fluorine, getting lower the further from there  

## Boiling Points  
- Increase down the group  
- Stronger intermolecular forces between atoms due to higher Mr causes increased boiling temperature  

## Oxidising Ability  
- Higher in the group = stronger oxidiser  
- Fluorine  
	o Very, very strong oxidising agent  
	o Able to oxidise water to oxygen

	o Virtually impossible to do simple reactions with  
- Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine  
	o A halogen higher in the group can oxidise the ions of the elements below it (in the periodic table)  
	o Chlorine can oxidise bromide ions [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74820599/111063602-87f02800-84a7-11eb-845f-5a09813516eb.png)  
	o Chlorine can oxidise iodide ions ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74820599/111063616-9d655200-84a7-11eb-8d89-bb165867ee38.png)  
	o Bromine can oxidise iodide ions ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74820599/111063630-b110b880-84a7-11eb-8333-ecc4ca20c5bb.png)  
	o Iodine won‚Äôt oxidise any of the halide ions (except astatine ‚Äì which is radioactive)  

## Testing for Halide Ions  
- Acidified silver nitrate  
	o Must be done in solution  
	o Acidified with nitric acid, removing anything that might give a confusing precipitate

	o Silver fluoride (ùê¥ùëîùêπ) is soluble, so doesn‚Äôt produce a precipitate  
- Confirming with Ammonia solution  
	o Add ammonia solution to the precipitates  

# 3.2.3.2 Uses of Chlorine and Chlorate(I)  
## Chlorine + Water: Chloride ions + Chlorate(I) ions  
- Chlorine is a pale green, toxic gas  
- Dissolves in water to give a pale green solution  
- Chlorine is very reactive with water, undergoing a chemical change  
	o ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74820599/111063763-6f344200-84a8-11eb-809d-23774c2413ce.png)  
	o This is a disproportionation reaction, where chlorine gets oxidised and reduced simultaneously

- Testing chlorine water with indicator paper first turns red, then gets bleached by the hypochlorous acid  
Chlorine + Water: Chloride ions + Oxygen  
- In the presence of UV light, when chlorine is added to water, HCl and O2 are produced  
	o ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74820599/111063830-af93c000-84a8-11eb-91f6-cd3c721b287a.png)  

## Chlorine in Water Treatment  
- Chlorine is used to kill pathogens in water treatment processes  
- This does not impact human health, due to the low concentrations used  
- Helps reduce the risk that pathogens may cause if they were untreated ‚Äì reduces likelihood of waterborne illnesses  

## Chlorine + NaOH  
- Chlorine reacts with cold, dilute NaOH solution, forming salts  
- Sodium hydroxide neutralises the chlorine water, forming salts

- When chlorine is bubbled through NaOH solution, NaCl, NaClO3, and water are produced

	o This is a disproportionation reaction, with chlorine being oxidised and reduced simultaneously
