## Chemical Equilibria and Le Chatelier’s Principle  
- Many chemical reactions are reversible  
- Reversible reactions, at equilibrium:  
	o Forward and reverse reactions occur at equal rates  
	o Concentration of reactants and products remain constant  
- Le Chatelier’s Principle  
	o Used to predict the effects of changing the temperature, concentration, and pressure on the position of equilibrium  
- Catalysts do not change the position of equilibrium  

## Equilibrium Constant – Kc  
- Kc is determined from the equation for a reversible reaction

- The concentration of a species is given in mol dm-3  
- Equilibrium constant is not changed by changes in concentration, or a catalyst being added  
- The […] denotes concentration
